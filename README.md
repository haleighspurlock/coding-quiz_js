## Description
---
Enjoy this fundamentals of JavaScript quiz! Included in this repository is code designed to create a timed quiz, which also keeps track of high scores. The requirements for this project were to create dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

This project was an incredible way to understand JavaScript. It tests your limits, because you need to utilize functions, for loops, and different types of DOM manipulation in order to get the outcome you're looking for. I highly reccommend this type of project to anyone trying to learn or improve their coding skills. USER BEWARE: tears may occur!!
